# Assignments for Foundations of Parallel and Distributive Computing

## Introduction

This is the repository of assignments of the course *Foundations of Parallel and Distributive Computing* lectured by *Chao Yang* in Fall 2018. The author of this repository is [Zhihan Li](mailto:lzh2016p@pku.edu.cn).

This repository relies on the personal TeX templates package [ptmpls](https://github.com/pppppass/ptmpls). Remember to specify `--recursive` option when cloning the repository.

## Organization

Please descend into each directory for detailed information. There are current two folders:
1. `Mandel`: the first assignment, calculation of area of the Mandelbrot set.
2. `MatMul`: the second assignment, matrix multiplication using CUDA.

## Usage

Please descend into each directory to check the Makefile for each assignment. Executing `make` in the root directory compiles all the reports but does not compile or run the programs.
